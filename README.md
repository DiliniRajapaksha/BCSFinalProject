BCSFinalProject
===============

This is my individual project for the Professional Graduate Diploma in IT BCS (Equivalent to a final year project of BSc)
http://www.bcs.org/category/10669

I have developed a DVD renting system for a small business.
It is a desktop application developed using java6. The user interface is developed using swing and the following design patterns are used in the application
1. Model View Controller
2. Front Controller
3. Data Access Object
4. Singleton

I have developed a generic table model for creating tables for the user interface, which involves custom annotation processing as well.
JPA is used for ORM.
